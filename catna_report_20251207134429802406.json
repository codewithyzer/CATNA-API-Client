Key Insights about Training Gaps**\n\nBased on the `Overall_Top_3_Needs` and the frequency of \"Lowest_Component\" in `Individual_Training_Plans`, the most critical training gaps across the university are:\n\n*   **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)**: This is by far the most frequently identified lowest component for individuals (194 instances, 24.16% of all individual training plans). This suggests a widespread need for foundational knowledge refresh or updates across various roles and colleges. The `Overall_Top_3_Needs` does not list CK explicitly, but its high frequency in individual plans points to a significant underlying issue. It also appears as the primary or secondary focus area for many groups in the `Group_Mean_Plans_Office_College` and `Group_Mean_Plans_Supervisor` sections.\n*   **Functional Know-How (FK - Administration Services)**: Ranked 3rd overall with a mean score of 3.12, and it's the second most frequent lowest component for individuals (122 instances, 15.19%). This highlights a consistent need for practical, job-specific administrative skills across the university.\n*   **Organizational Effectiveness (OS - Practical/Work-Based Skill Trainings)**: Ranked 1st overall with the lowest mean score of 3.09, and it's the third most frequent lowest component for individuals (99 instances, 12.33%). This indicates a general demand for improving practical work skills and processes to enhance overall organizational efficiency. The component `FS` (Practical/work-based skill trainings (organizational effectiveness - FS)), which seems to be a specific type under `OS`, is also quite frequent (44 instances, 5.48%). If combined, organizational effectiveness training (OS + FS) would be even higher.\n*   **Specialized Knowledge (SK - Academic Programs)**: This is another significant area, being the fourth most frequent lowest component for individuals (80 instances, 9.97%). This is particularly relevant for academic and research roles.\n*   **Attitude and Work Effectiveness (AW)**: Ranked 2nd overall with a mean score of 3.1, and appears frequently as a lowest component for individuals (36 instances, 4.49%). This indicates a need for improving general work attitudes and behaviors.\n*   **Attitude and Work Relationship (ACW)**: This focuses on interpersonal aspects of work and accounts for 24 individual training plans (2.99%). This is related to AW but specifically targets relationships.\n*   **Attitude and Customer Service (ACS)**: This is identified as the lowest component for 50 individuals (6.23%). This indicates a specific need for enhancing service-oriented attitudes and skills.\n*   **Effective Personal Management (SMS)**: This area focuses on personal organization and efficiency, with 40 individuals needing this training (4.98%).\n\n**Specific Weaknesses by Overall Rating:**\nSeveral individuals have very low overall ratings (e.g., Anika Rosales, Kiko Delos Reyes, Aria Bautista, etc., all with 0.0, though these might be data entry issues or signify extreme lack of competency). Ignoring the 0.0 entries, Kevin Salvador (Lecturer, CICS) has an Overall_Rating of 1.52, with FK as his lowest component. Rico Bautista (Instructor III, CICS) has 1.96, with CK as his lowest. Paolo Ocampo (Lecturer, CICS) has 2.04, with SK as his lowest. These indicate severe deficiencies in functional know-how, content knowledge, and specialized knowledge, respectively, for these individuals.\n\n**2. Recommendations for Training Prioritization**\n\nBased on the identified gaps, the following training priorities are recommended for Batangas State University:\n\n1.  **High Priority: Core Knowledge and Functional Skills (CK & FK)**\n    *   **\"Orientation seminar on content-based knowledge (CK)\"**: Given its overwhelming frequency as the lowest component (24.16% of individuals), this should be the top priority. Many individuals, including faculty, technicians, and admin staff, lack foundational knowledge. Targeted seminars per department/subject matter should be rolled out.\n    *   **\"Training on functional know-how (administration services - FK)\"**: As the 3rd ranked overall need and 2nd most frequent individual need, this is crucial for improving day-to-day operational efficiency. This should target administrative roles, but also faculty/staff who handle administrative tasks.\n\n2.  **Moderate-High Priority: Organizational & Specialized Skills (OS, FS & SK)**\n    *   **\"Practical/work-based skill trainings (organizational effectiveness - OS)\" and \"Practical/work-based skill trainings (organizational effectiveness - FS)\"**: Combining these two (as they are related to organizational effectiveness) makes this a significant area. These trainings should focus on improving work processes, efficiency, and overall operational skills.\n    *   **\"Conceptual training on specialized topics (academic programs - SK)\"**: Essential for maintaining academic quality and relevance, especially for faculty and research-oriented positions. This should be tailored to specific colleges and disciplines.\n\n3.  **Moderate Priority: Attitude and Interpersonal Skills (AW, ACS, ACW & SMS)**\n    *   **\"Trainings related to further development of attitude and work effectiveness (AW)\"**: This addresses general work ethics and effectiveness.\n    *   **\"Trainings related to further development of attitude and customer service (ACS)\"**: Crucial for roles interacting with students, parents, and external stakeholders.\n    *   **\"Trainings related to further development of attitude and work relationship (ACW)\"**: Important for fostering a harmonious and productive work environment.\n    *   **\"Practical/work-based skill training (effective personal management - SMS)\"**: This addresses individual time management, stress management, and self-organization, which are foundational for all other competencies.\n\n**Prioritization Strategy:**\n\n*   **Immediate University-Wide Focus:** Develop and deploy comprehensive programs for **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** and **Functional Know-How (FK)** due to their widespread deficiency.\n*   **Targeted Interventions:** Simultaneously, use the individual and group-level data to implement targeted programs for **Organizational Effectiveness (OS/FS)** and **Specialized Knowledge (SK)** in specific colleges or for particular positions (e.g., intensive SK workshops for academic coordinators, OS/FS for administrative teams).\n*   **Holistic Development:** Integrate elements of **Attitude (AW, ACS, ACW)** and **Personal Management (SMS)** into all training programs, or offer them as standalone workshops for continuous professional development.\n*   **Address Low Performers:** Identify individuals with extremely low overall ratings (e.g., below 2.5) and provide them with immediate, personalized coaching and mandatory training in their lowest component areas.\n\n**3. Notable Trends or Patterns Across Groups**\n\n**A. Office/College Trends:**\n\n*   **Overall Group Ratings:**\n    *   **Highest Performers (Overall_Group_Rating):** CISC (3.57), CAFAD (3.15), CICS (3.15), COE (3.17), CET (3.22). These colleges generally have higher average competency levels.\n    *   **Lowest Performers (Overall_Group_Rating):** CIS (0.3), Architecture (2.8), Business (2.71), Education (2.78), Engineering (2.69), IT (2.68). These colleges require more urgent and extensive training interventions. The CIS rating is suspiciously low, possibly indicating incomplete data.\n*   **Specific Needs by College:**\n    *   **CAFAD, CET, CICS, COE (Larger Colleges):** Show a very high demand for **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (25-29% of training plans) and **Functional Know-How (FK)** (16-19%). This suggests that even within these higher-performing colleges, foundational knowledge and administrative skills are common weak points.\n    *   **Architecture & Engineering:** Show a diverse range of needs, with \"Practical/work-based skill trainings (organizational effectiveness - FS)\" and \"Attitude and Work Effectiveness (AW)\" for Architecture, and \"Conceptual training on specialized topics (academic programs - SK)\" and \"Organizational Effectiveness (FS & FK)\" for Engineering. This points to diverse operational and technical skill gaps.\n    *   **Business:** Focus heavily on \"Orientation seminar on content-based knowledge (CK)\" (30.77%) and \"Conceptual training on specialized topics (academic programs - SK)\" (23.08%).\n    *   **IT:** Shows high demand for \"Functional Know-How (FK)\" (22.22%), \"Attitude and Customer Service (ACS)\" (16.67%), and \"Conceptual training on specialized topics (academic programs - SK)\" (11.11%).\n    *   **CISC & CIT:** Have relatively few data points in the `Percentage_Breakdowns` (3 and 10 entries, respectively), making robust conclusions difficult, but show strong needs in \"Attitude and Work Relationship (ACW)\" for CISC and \"Specialized Knowledge (SK)\" for CIT.\n\n**B. Position-based Trends:**\n\n*   **Instructors (including Instructor I, II, III):** Show a high need across **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (21.29%), **Functional Know-How (FK)** (18.88%), **Specialized Knowledge (SK)** (16.87%), and **Organizational Effectiveness (OS)** (16.06%). This suggests a holistic need for development in teaching, administrative, and general organizational skills. The very low scores for some instructors (e.g., Paolo Ocampo at 2.04) are concerning and require immediate attention.\n*   **Technicians (including \"Technician \"):** Dominated by needs in **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (24.19%), **Functional Know-How (FK)** (17.74%), and **Specialized Knowledge (SK)** (14.52%). This aligns with their roles requiring both technical expertise and operational understanding.\n*   **Admin Assistants:** Highly focused on **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (25.68%) and **Functional Know-How (FK)** (20.27%), which is expected given their roles in administrative support.\n*   **Coordinators:** Have diverse needs, but **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (30.68%) and **Organizational Effectiveness (OS)** (21.59%) stand out. This suggests they need strong foundational knowledge and managerial/organizational skills to effectively lead.\n*   **Faculty Members:** Primarily need **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (31.71%) and **Functional Know-How (FK)** (16.26%), followed by **Specialized Knowledge (SK)** (13.82%). This highlights the need to keep their core academic knowledge updated and also improve their administrative efficiency.\n*   **Staff:** Show high demand for **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (27.78%) and **Functional Know-How (FK)** / **Organizational Effectiveness (OS)** (both 17.59%).\n*   **Department/Deparment Secretaries:** Primarily need **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (70-75%), indicating a critical need for foundational knowledge relevant to their secretarial and departmental support roles.\n\n**C. Campus Trends:**\n\n*   Only \"Alangilan\" campus data is provided, showing its top needs are consistent with the overall university priorities: **Content-Based Knowledge (CK)** (25.76%), **Functional Know-How (FK)** (17.46%), and **Organizational Effectiveness (OS)** (14.73%). This suggests that campus-wide initiatives should align with these broader needs.\n\n**D. Years in Current Position Trends:**\n\n*   **Consistent Needs Across All Tenure Levels (1-12 years"}
